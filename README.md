# 0x04. Files Manager

## Overview

Welcome to the Files Manager project! This project is a comprehensive summary of our back-end trimester, focusing on essential technologies and concepts such as authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files, integrating various back-end technologies and practices.

### Project Details

- **Domain:** Back-end
- **Technologies:** JavaScript, ES6, NoSQL, MongoDB, Redis, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Kue
- **Team Members:** Khofi Adjei, Future Kingsford
- **Project Duration:** August 1, 2024, 6:00 AM - August 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** August 3, 2024, 12:00 AM
- **Manual QA Review:** Request when the project is complete
- **Auto Review:** Launched at the project deadline

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple platform that allows users to upload and view files. The platform will include the following features:

1. **User Authentication via a Token**
2. **Listing All Files**
3. **Uploading a New File**
4. **Changing Permissions of a File**
5. **Viewing a File**
6. **Generating Thumbnails for Images**

This project will guide you step-by-step through the building process, but you have the freedom to implement additional features, split functionalities into more files, etc. The `utils` folder will be your friend.
